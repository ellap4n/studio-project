## Formulating the idea
I'm interested in art from rules and glitches. Both are topics with endless possibilities within. 

#### Art from rules
The idea for this topic I have is for the user to answer a prompt, and the code will scan the string for specific characters or rules (# of vowels etc.) which will trigger different outcomes. Each response would output a unique outcome based on these 'rules'. 
Rules aer fundamental in code as esseantially everything you write in code is a rule - its unchanging and cannot be removed once determined. 

#### Glitches 
I really liked my workshop 3 exploration - the morer you click, the more tinted the images became. I could replace the tint with glitches - the more you click, the more the image glitches, playing into the idea of entropy - where the chaos, or entropy of the universe tends to a maximum. The more you interact with something, the less ordered it becomes. Consumerism - use breaks things down, but if you leave it as it is it will remain pristine. Naivety. The more you think, the more problems you discover. 

Im also intrigued by the idea of 'designing imperfection' which is actual an essential technique in art that focuses on realism. to be real is to be imperfect.
